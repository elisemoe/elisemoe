### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Elise! 

💖 &nbsp;  I'm Director of Programs on the GitHub Education team  
🌈 &nbsp;  trying to make development more social and inclusive

I’m currently learning:  
🌱 &nbsp;   about academic OPSOs, contribution ladders, and mentorship models within OSS  
🌍 &nbsp;  about managing across cross-cultural teams  
🪵 &nbsp;  and how to carve wooden spoons 

I'm currently reading:  
📚 &nbsp;  Small Is Beautiful: Economics as if People Mattered (by E.F. Schumacher)  
🔮 &nbsp;  The Last Lecture (by Randy Pausch) 

Ask me about:  
🪩 &nbsp;  community building  
🤓 &nbsp;  behavioral economics   
🏔️ &nbsp;  my never ending quest to climb mountains


Get in touch:  
💌 &nbsp;  if you have feedback about GitHub Education, building a sustainable open source ecosystem, or mentorship models within OSS, send me a DM on Twitter – I'd love to chat.
